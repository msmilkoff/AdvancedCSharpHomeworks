	Are you a person who is easily distracted?
In the midst of a busy day at the office finding creative space to concentrate and forge ahead is a real challenge.
Here's a suggestion... it's possible to set up a creative space by playing baroque background music as you work.
Not your style? If you're willing to give it a trial, the results may surprise you. Here's why...
	In a three year research study, Maya Ruvinshteyn and Leonard Parrino, instructors in math at Essex County College
and Rutgers-Newark, found when they played baroque background music in their classes, it made a difference.
Here's how...
86 % of students surveyed enjoyed class more with baroque background music,
whereas 76 % of students without any music found the class enjoyable.
33 % of students found math challenging whereas 46 % in the class without the baroque music found it challenging.
	Earlier research findings show that Baroque music enhances learning of foreign languages
and improves performance in some types of tests.
Why Baroque Music? Research reveals that Baroque music pulses between 50 to 80 beats per minute.
Baroque music "stabilizes mental, physical and emotional rhythms," according to Chris Boyd Brewer,
"to attain a state of deep concentration and focus in which large amounts of content information can be processed and learned."
	Music affects your brain waves.
Slower baroques, such as Bach, Handel, Vivaldi or Corelli, can create mentally stimulating environments for creativity
and new innovations. Alpha brain waves originate from the occipital lobe during periods of relaxation.
As you relax you can move out of stressors that otherwise impede your creativity.
